            Concrete is extensively used for building construction and other infrastructure projects. It is generally a workable or flow-able material in its fresh state, which allows it to take the shape of the formwork, with the help of external vibration. Depending on the size, orientation, location and the strength requirements of the structural component made of concrete, it may take few hours to few days before the formwork is stripped and/or next stage of construction can take place. The conventional concrete construction is labor-intensive, time-consuming, needs costly formwork in complex structures, incurs high transportation and installation cost, challenging in adverse climatic conditions, and lacks automation. COVID-19 pandemic has further led to a shortage of labor across the country, which may lead to high project cost in near future. Hence, there will be the need of automated construction solutions in coming days.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The additive manufacturing or 3D printing of concrete is a highly automated construction process where the concrete structure is built-up layer-by-layer without form-work support. We, at MiCoB Private Limited, have developed a 3D concrete which has a printing area of 9 square meter (3 meter x 3 meter), and printable height of 3 meter. This project is funded by Startup Gujarat and IIT Gandhinagar. A smaller prototype was also developed to test various properties of printed concrete structures. We have solved 2 critical problems in 3D Concrete Printing. One is the print quality, and second is the print consistency. Three patents have been filed by us on this indigenously developed 3D Concrete Printing technology.

          Over the past few decades technology has been drastically changing the way of life in the society hence lives of the current generation has been significantly improved by completely becoming dependent on new technologies. It also allows multiple tasks to be completed in less time along with increased efficiency and creates entirely new way to make a living. Shopping mall is a place where most of the people hurry to get their daily necessities. However, shopping carts in major stores have experienced little changes. Consumers often face problems as they are tedious and in-convenience to push or pull these carts around and becomes noticeably painful to carry the heavy loads. Even collision occurs if obstacles arise out of sight. After this one, needs to go to billing counter for payments which is a time-consuming process and also results in a long queue at the counters. Our aim is to design an intelligent cart that follows the customer and makes automatic billing by using the modern sensors and micro-controller which provides more satisfaction and comfortable to the user. Our motto to this shopping society is “Why not your cart be your dog”.

            For 1.3 billion people, there are only 10,000 dermatologists. 90% of the patients suffering from skin diseases do not have access to a dermatologist. Most of the time, skin diseases, which could be life-threatening, are often overlooked.

        Omni-Channel Ingestion: The platform takes omni-data and Omni-channel view by ingesting every kind of data in our ecosystem, protecting the customers from the beginning of their transaction journeys to the end. To get a complete view of every transaction, an organization needs a platform that can instantly ingest every kind of data, whether it’s coming from an internal system, like your Account Management System, or external data sources, like enrichers. Many sources, one story: Transactional data<--->online session data—customer data----user device data—third party data.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Agility: The platform adapts to the organization as it scales and support custom models that are based on domain expertise of the fraud patterns specific to the industry. A platform with a flexible and agile architecture, developed by data scientists with domain expertise in specific industries. Custom models that are built with domain expertise in fraud science, specifically for financial services, produce more power and more insight by taking into account the unique fraud patterns that banking and payments face.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Explainable Logic: The platform has white-box AI that contains a human-readable semantic layer that explains its underlying logics and puts the human in control. For example, an explanation might say that the user has been declined because there were four recent transactions in distant locations. The idea here is to put humans in control, by communicating clearly about why certain transactions were approved or declined and arming them with the information they need to review customer account activity more intelligently.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Hyper-Granular Profiling: The platform detects anomalies by creating normal behaviour profiles for segments of many and reaches its decisions to create profiles of normal behaviour, and flag instances of abnormal behaviour. By creating profiles of many different entities (the branch, the day of the week, the credit card), machine learning platforms can reach new levels of sensitivity, and detect fraud with greater power and accuracy.

        At InfyU Labs, we are developing a handheld device which can determine the quality of fruits and vegetables non-invasively at the source of procurement itself. The device is capable of doing non-invasive rapid testing of fruits for nutritional values and harmful chemicals present based on their BRIX level, ripeness stage, and pesticide content threshold. Additionally, with our cloud-based app, clients can remotely monitor the grade of incoming raw material and can generate reports for the same. Our handheld device enables our clients to do testing at the source of procurement. Thus, removing the cost and wastage involved during the transportation of fruit samples for testing before purchase and ensuring quality traceability of the consignment.

        Problem:
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Stroke has emerged as the second most leading cause of death, causing 11.8% of all deaths globally in 2013. Annual incidence rate of stroke in India is 163 per 100,000 per year which is greater than many european countries. Recent advancements in healthcare facilities has led to an overall decline in the death. However, the number of people suffering post stroke disability has increased significantly. About 80% of the stroke survivors suffer long term motor impairments. Impairment of the upper limb (arm and hand) severely impacts the quality of life and the socio-economic conditions of the stroke survivors. Hand functions are a critical requirement to perform activities of daily living independently. Rehabilitation of the hand therefore becomes a critical requirement.

        Product idea/Solution:
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        1) We are developing a virtual reality platform that offers customisable gamified activities and exercises to engage and motivate patients to perform the otherwise boring rehab exercises for extended durations.
        <br>2) We have developed a wearable sensorized glove that offers excellent accuracy and repeatability in measuring finger kinematic parameters such as range of motion, reaction time, flexure speed, stability of patients hand functions etc. A provisional patent is already filed. We also won the outstanding results award for demonstrating the performance of the glove at a leading international conference.
        <br>3) Motorized force-feedback system to assist patients in making finger movements.
        <br>4) Cloud-based mobile platform for tele-assessment and seeking second opinion from expert doctors.
        <br>5) Artificial intelligence/machine learning based smart system for patient disability assessment and recovery timeline predictions.
